I'm a first year phd student from William & Mary, advised by Professor [Huajie Shao](https://huajieshao.github.io/index.html). My current research interest focuses on developing physics‑informed machine learning methods to build generalizable world models, with applications spanning robotics, autonomous driving, and power systems.
